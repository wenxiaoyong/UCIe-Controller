A.1 CXL Registers ap plicability to UCIe
All CXL-defined DVSECs fully apply in the context of UCIe when operating in Raw Format. When 
operating in non-Raw Format, a few register definiti ons need to be reinterpreted in the context of 
UCIe. See below for details. Note that regardless of  the Raw Format or non-Raw Format, device/port 
configurations with CXL 1.1 compliance is not permitted as was discussed in Chapter 9.0 .
A.2 PCIe Register applicability to UCIe
All PCIe specifications defined DVSEC apply in the context of UCIe as well. There are a few Link and 
PHY layer registers/bits though that are N/A or need  to be reinterpreted in the context of UCIe. They 
are listed below.Table A-1. CXL Registers for UCIe devices

connected to a retimer or not, and also the retimer based exit latency might 
not be known at design time as well. To assist with this, these bits need to be 
made HWInit from a device/port perspective so system FW can set this at boot time based on the specific retimer based latencies.
