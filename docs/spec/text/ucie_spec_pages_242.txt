6.1 Introduction
Three-dimensional heterogeneously integrated technologies present an opportunity for the 
development of new electronic systems with adva ntages of higher bandwidth and lower power as 
compared to 2D and 2.5D architectures. 3D will  enable applications where the scale of data 
movement is impractical for monolithic, 2D, or 2.5D approaches.
Universal Chiplet Interconnect express for 3D pa ckaging (UCIe-3D) is designed as a universally 
applicable interface for 3D die-to-die communication. Figure 6-1  illustrates an example of two dies 
stacked in a 3D configuration. UCIe-3D uses a two- dimensional array of interconnect bumps for data 
transmission between dies.
6.2 UCIe-3D Features and Summary
While the UCIe 2D and 2.5D models strive for se amless plug-and-play interoperability, the UCIe-3D 
model necessitates a more-integrated approach due to the inherent characteristics of packaging 
technology. The objective is to offer a range of options or a “menu” from which users can select what 
best suits their needs. The primary objectives an d general methodology for UCIe-3D are as follows:
• Circuit and logic must fit within the bump area (i.e ., UCIe will continue to be bump-limited). Given 
the high density, this will translate to lower operating frequencies and a much-simplified circuit 
(e.g., at 1-um bump-pitch, the UCIe-3D area amor tized on a per-lane basis must be less than 1 
um2).
• No D2D adapter. Low BER due to low-frequency and almost zero-channel distance — No CRC/ 
replay is needed.
• A hardened minimal PHY such as a simple invert er/driver. The SoC Logic connects directly to the 
PHY.Figure 6-1. Example of 3D Die Stacking

Figure 6-3  presents the Transceiver (Trx) architecture of UCIe-3D. A matched architecture as shown 
in Figure 5-4 , Figure 5-8 , and Figure 5-13  offers optimal supply noise re jection. However, this comes 
at the cost of increased power consumption. The architecture depicted in Figure 6-3  circumvents this 
power penalty while maintaining the same level of supply noise rejection. The UCIe-3D specification 
will establish target values and tolerances for clock distribution delays D1 and D2.
It is important to highlight that UCIe-3D uses a rise-to-fall timing approach, differing from the typical 
on-die logic design that uses a rise-to-rise timing approach. The primary distinction between these two scenarios is that on-die logic must factor in  the delay caused by comb inational logic, whereas 
UCIe-3D features matched data and clock buffer de lays, resulting in a near-zero differential. As 
depicted in Figure 6-4 , rise-to-fall timing yields the most-optimal timing margin for zero-delay 
differential.Figure 6-3. UCIe-3D PHY

6.4.1 Timing Budget
Consideration of various factors such as jitter, noise, mismatch, and error terms are crucial for the link 
timing budget. Table 6-2  outlines the UCIe-3D specification parameters that are pertinent to link 
timing. Pulse width deviation from 50% clock period includes both static error (duty-cycle error) and 
dynamic error (pulse-width jitter). Lane-to-lane sk ews account for the variation between data lanes, 
and Data/Clock differential delays account for the clock to center of distribution of data lanes.Figure 6-4. Start Edge and Sample Edge

August 6, 2024 Property of Universal Chiplet In terconnect Express (UCIe) © 2022–2024 Figure 6-5  illustrates a plot of the spec range for 4 GT/s.
The equation for delay time, derived from the gene ral theory of buffer chain, incorporates a term 
proportional to Vcc and a quadratic Vcc dependence in the denominator. This equation is fitted to a 
specific process and design. A typical design is expe cted to have the same trend, and remain within 
the boundaries of the upper and lower curves. It is  not required to align with the central curve.
Equation 6-6  is essential in closing the timing budget, subsequently leading to the defined 
specification limit.
Equation 6-6.
When there is a change in Vcc, as in the case of  a dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) scenario, 
the specification range for Dtx and Drx adjusts correspondingly. This offers a degree of design 
flexibility because the delay does not need to conf orm to a fixed band across the entire Vcc range. 
Given that the range from maximum to minimum remains constant, the timing margin remains 
unaffected.

The feasibility of 0-V ESD should be explored for th e special case of wafer-to-wafer hybrid bonding. 
For more details, see the Industry Council on ESD Targets white papers.
For > 10 um to < 25 um bump pitches, higher ESD can be permitted. The exact target will be 
published in a future revision of the specification.
Table 6-4  lists the Energy Efficiency targets.
6.4.3 UCIe-3D Module and Bump Map
Figure 6-6  depicts a potential bump map for UCIe-3D. The arrangement of the signals is such that the 
same PHY can be utilized on both the to p die and bottom die. The unit used in Figure 6-6  is the bump 
pitch. The estimated area for a x80 module (enc ompassing both Tx and Rx) in a 9-um pitch is 
approximately 0.02 mm2. It is important to note that the area scales with the square of the bump 
pitch.
The UCIe-3D standard does not prescribe a mand atory bump pitch; however, a 9-um pitch is 
recommended at introduction. As the technology advances, additional specific recommended pitch 
values will be established.Table 6-3. ESD Specification for ≤ 10 um Bump Pitch

UCIe Specification Revision 2.0, Version 1.0 249
August 6, 2024 Property of Universal Chiplet In terconnect Express (UCIe) © 2022–2024 Although UCIe-3D does not inherently predefine an ad apter, users have the flexibility to allocate some 
data lanes within the module for adapter functions as  required, such as Valid, Data Mask, Parity, and 
ECC. UCIe-3D does not necessitate a sideband for init ialization. If a low-bandwidth data link similar to 
sideband is required, it is up to the implementati on to determine how to assign a group of lanes for 
the purpose. Bit replication or other forms of red undancy can be used to guarantee link reliability.
If modules are physically adjacent, extra VDDs can be added between them to provide physical 
separation, shielding, and additional power delivery.
Along with x80, the bump map of x70 Module is depicted in Figure 6-7 . Bump maps of additional 
Module widths may be incorporated in a future upda te to this specification if needed, using similar 
layout.
6.4.4 Repair Strategy
Defect size (more exactly, Si area impacted by a si ngle defect) is defined by a probability distribution. 
The size is influenced by factors such as number s of I/Os in SoC, packaging technology used, and 
bump pitch. A standard needs to cover technologies from multiple companies, scalable to future bump 
pitches, as well as different SoC si zes. Lane repair based on fixed defect size is not practical for an 
effective standard.
Given these considerations, a bundle repair strategy is proposed for UCIe-3D. This involves reserving 
bundles within the SoC for repair purposes, which can be rerouted to serve as backup in the event of 
a failure, as illustrated in Figure 6-8 . The figure shows the cases of no repair, 1-bundle repair, and 4-
bundle repairs. For a densely packed 2D UCIe Module array, it is recommended to reserve two full Modules (equivalent to four bundles) to repair a single failure. This assumes an alternating 
arrangement of Tx and Rx bundles in at least one direction. Each Module is  equipped with one Tx 
bundle (comprising a x80 Tx + Clock) and on e Rx bundle (comprising a x80 Rx + Clock).Figure 6-7. x70 Module

August 6, 2024 Property of Universal Chiplet In terconnect Express (UCIe) © 2022–2024 To scale the general case of a large number of UC Ie links, the following mathematical model can be 
used to compute the repair requirements:
Parameters:
•D0 represents the defect density of the interconnect, expressed in terms of the number of failures 
per unit area
• A signifies the total UCIe-3D area of the chip•δ denotes the acceptable yield loss
The model suggests reserving 2k full Modules, wh ere k is determined by the subsequent equation.
Equation 6-7.
Equation 6-8.
The calculations in Equation 6-7  and Equation 6-8  assume that large interconnect defects that are 
comparable to bundle size are relatively rare. More  spare bundles may be needed if density of large 
defects exceeds a limit such that Equation 6-9  does not hold.Figure 6-8. Bundle Repair

where, D1 is the density of defects with diameter greater than the bundle dimension. The exact 
amount can be determined by simulation.
When UCIe-3D links are not densely packed, stra tegic placement of spacing between bundles can 
effectively reduce the number of repair bundles required. For ex ample, with sufficient spacing 
between rows, the occurrence of a single defect elim inating four bundles can be prevented. However, 
the precise determination of this spacing is highly dependent on the specific technology in use, and 
thus, falls beyond the scope of this specification. Th e specification merely highlights this as a potential 
option.
The initiation of repair is anticipated to originate from the SoC Logic, which is external to the UCIe-3D 
PHY, and therefore is not elaborated on in this co ntext. The implementation can be specific to the 
system.
6.4.5 Channel and Data Rate Extension
While the immediate focus of UCIe-3D is on Face-to-Fa ce hybrid bonding, the proposed architecture is 
designed to be adaptable for Face-to-Back, Back-to-Back, and multi-stack configurations. 
Comprehensive channel and circuit simulations are ne cessary to determine the optimal data rate for 
these scenarios. Reduction of 10% or less in data rate is expected for Face-to-Back and Back-to-Back 
configurations.
