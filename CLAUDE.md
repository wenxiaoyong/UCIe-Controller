## Project Overview

This is a UCIe (Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express) controller development project based on UCIe Specification v2.0. The project focuses on designing and implementing a SystemVerilog-based controller for UCIe interconnect supporting multiple protocols and packaging technologies.

## UCIe Architecture Components

### Core Layers
1. **Protocol Layer**: Supports PCIe, CXL, Streaming, and Management Transport protocols
2. **Die-to-Die (D2D) Adapter**: Coordinates between Protocol and Physical layers, handles CRC/Retry, Link state management
3. **Physical Layer**: Contains PHY logic, Analog Front End (AFE), Lane training, and scrambling

### Key Interfaces
- **Raw Die-to-Die Interface (RDI)**: Protocol-agnostic raw interface
- **Flit-Aware Die-to-Die Interface (FDI)**: Flit-based protocol interface
- **Sideband**: Control plane for parameter exchange and Link management (800 MHz fixed clock)
- **Mainband**: High-speed data path with forwarded clock and N data lanes

### Package Support
- **Standard Package**: Low-cost, 10-25mm reach, 100-130μm bump pitch, up to 32 GT/s
- **Advanced Package**: High-performance, <2mm reach, 25-55μm bump pitch, up to 32 GT/s  
- **UCIe-3D**: 3D stacking, <10μm optimized pitch, up to 4 GT/s
